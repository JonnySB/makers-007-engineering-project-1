# How to run an efficient Team Stand-up

**General time guidelines**
1. Each member of the team to update, if they have something to update.
2. Try to keep each update to 1 minute, and then an additional minute or so for any questions / concerns.
3. Keep the overall retro to 15 minutes.

**Keep the focus on the day ahead**
Focus on the day ahead, rather than retelling the story of your past. Here are some pointers:
* what is your main focus for the day
* what do you hope to achieve by the end of the day
* do you have any blockers, and how can you and your team unblock work together to unblock you
* do you have any questions or knowledge gaps that you can get support with from your team

**Nominate someone to lead the retro**
This person's responsibility is timekeeping, updating the Trello board, and reminding people of
some of the points / questions listed above (or any others). It's common practice in the industry
to change the person leading the retro, but there are also sometimes organisations where one person
mostly leads.

# A note on the term 'blocker'

Sometimes it is easy to use the term 'blocker' when describing any problem that you can't
quite get your head around on a given day. However, not every problem is a blocker.

A blocker is something that stops the 'flow' of the agile process i.e. for you to
be able to move forward with a particular task, you need another task to be completed
first. It is not, for example, that you cannot understand a particular concept to implement. That
is a knowledge gap, and can be resolved in a different way.
