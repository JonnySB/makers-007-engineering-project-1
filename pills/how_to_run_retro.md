# How to run an interactive Team Retro

Before deciding, think about the kind of sprint you've had as a team, and what you would like to achieve with the retro. For example, was the sprint one full of bugs and blockers, or did your team work efficiently towards completion as well as keeping energy high?

You might aim for the goal of the retro to be focused on motivating and energising the team to continue despite a challenging few days. Or, you may want to bring focus in after a high energy sprint.

## Decide what you will use for your retro board

* If you're remote, [you can try using Miro](https://miro.com/templates/retrospective/) (many set retro template options - check out the Community Templates in the 'Miroverse' section for some really creative ones), [EasyRetro](http://easyretro.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/) (this is fun because of GIF!) or any other that you are comfortable with. The idea is that is should be somewhere where everyone can access a link and make additions or edits.
* In person, white boards, sticky notes, and moving people around the room can really help to draw out good ideas and reflections on the sprint gone and the sprint ahead. You can also still use a retro board.

## What to include on your retro board

* What were the highlights that helped keep the team progressing?
* What were the key things holding the team back?
* Who would they like to show appreciation for?
* What are some actions to take forward for the sprint ahead?

It is important to recognise that these reflections are less about personal challenges and achievements, but more about how the team works together.

The focus for a team retro will differ from that focused on the whole cohort. It can sometimes be useful to post a link to the retro board (if you are remote) in advance of the meeting (a few hours or even a day before) to allow people some time to reflect.

## A few more notes

* Make it fun or thought provoking - retros are a space for people to express or to release at the end of a sprint, so thinking about how that can happen is important.
* Be mindful of timekeeping - retros can stretch out for a very long time, especially if it has been a challenging sprint. Set some time for each section, and stick to it. If people have posted a lot of things, be selective.
* If challenges arise, keep things action-oriented - sometimes people can express big challenges in a retro, so if you need to manage this then try to bring focus to what action is required for that challenge to be resolved.
