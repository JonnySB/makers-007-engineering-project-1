# Guide for using Git/GitHub

## 1.  Add all your files, commit and push to your branch.

When in the branch you're working in, and you're happy with all your changes, use the following:
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

## 2. Checkout to main and pull any changes from main

Switch to the main branch and pull any changes from there:
```
git checkout main

git pull origin main
```

For example:
```shell
➜  makers-007-engineering-project-1 git:(story-2-list-spaces) git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
➜  makers-007-engineering-project-1 git:(main) git pull

remote: Counting objects: 100% (62/62), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (28/28), done.
remote: Total 42 (delta 23), reused 33 (delta 14), pack-reused 0

   f245360..eb5efea  story_7            -> origin/story_7
Already up to date.
```

## 3. Checkout to your branch and merge it with the main branch

Switch to your branch and merge it with the main branch.
```shell
git checkout your-branch-name

git fetch
git merge origin/main
```

For example:
```shell
➜  makers-007-engineering-project-1 git:(main) git checkout story-2-list-spaces
Switched to branch 'story-2-list-spaces'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/story-2-list-spaces'.
➜  makers-007-engineering-project-1 git:(story-2-list-spaces) git fetch
➜  makers-007-engineering-project-1 git:(story-2-list-spaces) git merge origin/main
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.

 lib/users.py          | 12 ++++++++++++

 3 files changed, 44 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 lib/users.py
 create mode 100644 tests/test_booking.py
```

## 4. Retest all your code with the new changes from main

Once you've merged your branch with the main, open your virtual environment and retest all your code with **pytest** and also **checking the html pages are working appropriately**.

For example:
```shell
➜  makers-007-engineering-project-1 git:(story-2-list-spaces) pipenv shell

If you're happy and there are no changes, exit your virtual environment.

For example:
```shell
(makers-007-engineering-project-1) ➜  makers-007-engineering-project-1 git:(story-2-list-spaces) exit
```

If there were changes, **repeat step 1** and do another pull to check there aren't any changes from main.

## 5. Push your final changes

Push your final changes when you're happy.

```shell
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Or if you're in your branch, just use
```shell
git push
```

## 6. Open up a pull request

If you've successfully completed **steps 1-5**, and would like your branch to be merged onto the main branch, open up a **pull request** and ask for your team to review it.

>[!CAUTION] 
>Make sure you do not just merge the changes FROM YOUR BRANCH to MAIN yourself! Ensure everyone has reviewed and approved your code first

If there are any issues with your code, make the appropriate changes and **repeat steps 1-5.**

>[!NOTE]
>If you have opened a pull request, any commits after that will be shown in that pull request so ensure your pull request is reviewed before you continue working on that branch.

If everything is approved and you merge your branch to the main branch, drop a message in the Slack channel to notify everyone to pull these changes.
