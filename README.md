# Engineering Project I (Makersbnb)

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/engineering_projects/makersbnb/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

This week you will:

* Learn to work and communicate effectively as part of a team to build a web application.
* Learn to break down projects into tasks and assign them to pairs.
* Learn to use agile ceremonies to organise your work and improve your processes.
* Learn to use the developer workflow to plan, implement and peer-review features.

## Introduction

Your coach will share the teams with you this morning. Once you have them, create a private slack channel with all team members and invite your coach to that channel.

Get together on a Zoom call (or gather in front of the same screen) and watch this introduction video.

## Project Setup

1. Create a private slack channel with all team members and invite the coach leading this
   week to that channel.
2. One member in your group should fork the seed repo for this project, and add the other
   members of your group as collaborators. Everyone will pull and push to this fork.
3. Add a link to this repo to the description of your team's slack channel.
4. [Read the project specification together](./specification.md)
5. Decide how you will work, by creating a small team charter — [here's a template you can
   use](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JbXksrTlu_-kCvq-ITzLucvFvv3QOFN9P_LsTRfQ3kM/edit).
6. Create a Trello board for your project, [using this
   template.](https://trello.com/invite/b/g9JBypiG/efd9585fe05fadab98ee0008be9df673/engineering-project-i-template)
7. Start turning the headline specifications into user stories and create one Trello
   ticket in the column "Backlog (all TODO)". 
8. Get a break, and then start [your first sprint](#agile-sprints).

## Agile Sprints and Ceremonies

Agile software teams work in sprints. At the beginning of a new sprint, the team decides
which features to work on in that sprint, and what to leave for later. This week, you will
work with shorter sprints of roughly two days. Here is a suggested schedule:
  * Monday to Tuesday - Sprint #1
  * Wednesday to Thursday - Sprint #2
  * Friday - Sprint #3
  * Stand-up every morning (15 min) after your peer groups check-ins.
  * Retro at the end of both sprints (and recommended at the end of each day of work).

@TODO stand-up video?

To start your first sprint:
  1. Get together as a team.
  2. Pick a few tickets from the tickets backlog, and move them to the "Current sprint"
     column — remember your goal is to get them done within this first sprint, so it's
     better to start with less initially. For this first sprint, pick tickets [relevant to
     the MVP of your project only](#minimum-viable-product-mvp). You can always extend the
     sprint with more tickets, if you find you're working faster than expected.
  3. Assign the first tickets to pairs.
  4. Get into your pairs, [watch this video](#developer-workflow), and start the work.

@TODO demo videos of running a short sprint, and a short retro? 

## Developer Workflow

Watch this video with your pair _before_ starting to work your first ticket.

feature -> PR -> code review -> merge)

[A description of the workflow is here](./pills/developer_workflow.md)

## Minimum viable product (MVP)

The smallest thing that implements the core idea. Think about what this is for Airbnb.
Build those user stories first. This MVP will exclude most of the headline specification
items in the spec.

If your specification asks for a car, don't build the wheels in the first week, the doors
in the second week, etc. The customer can't try it! Instead, build a skateboard in the
first week.

Aim to get to your MVP by the end of Tuesday.

## Breaking down user stories into tasks

Make sure each user story is small enough to be completable in less than half a day.

Some items in the spec include more than one feature. e.g. "Any signed up user can list a
new space". Break this into two user stories and prioritise the one that gets you as close
as possible to a product.

Use the customer's language (the domain language) in the user stories. Most words in the
user stories should appear in the spec.

Avoid splitting the work on the different "layers" of the program (e.g one pair working on the HTML view and one pair working on the Sinatra code). When working on a user story, you will have to work on all
these different components — [a feature will involve work on all the different layers of
your web application.](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/user-story-splitting-vertical-slice-vs-horizontal-slice/#:~:text=layers%20as%20possible.-,Vertical%20Slice%20vs%20Horizontal%20Slice,-A%20user%20story)

## Things to watch out for

* **Working overtime** — make sure your take breaks and swap pairs regularly. It's easy to
  get lost in the work and stretch yourself, but remember that this week's goal is also to
  learn how to work effectively. A team that is exhausted is not a great team to work in!
* **Rushing to get things done** - releasing features is important, but you shouldn't
  sacrifice your process in order to rush ahead. It's often better to start slow, and
  invest more time into deep learning and having strong processes and communication, so it
  pays off on the long run.
* **Sidelining testing** - more than ever, TDD and other software engineering practices
  you've learned so far will be important this week. Make sure that you don't skip over
  them. They will slow you down a bit at first, but it will pay off on the long run. If
  you din't they're slowing you down _too much_, maybe there is something to correct in
  your process — your coach can support with this.
* **Everyone's voice isn't heard** - it's important that everyone in the team gets their
  say on the project and how the team works, and that everyone feels like they can
  contribute, even if you're at different technical levels. If you feel that something
  isn't quite right, stand-ups or retros are a good place to raise it, in order to get the
  team to a better place. If you're not sure how to approach it, get in touch with your
  coach so they can support.
